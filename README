Spawncamper is a set of Python scripts to automate the discovery of new hosts
for Nagios monitoring, and to add those hosts to the Nagios configuration files.
It utilizes DNS zone transfers (AXFR) to pull data from a local DNS server,
and uses this information to determine if a given host already exists in the
Nagios configuration, adding it to a new_hosts.cfg file if not, and e-mails
relevant adminitrators to alert them to the discovery of a new host to add.

Spawncamper can be configured to use CIDR subnets or a specified IP range to
determine whether or not a host found in a given DNS zone should be monitored.
Inidividual hosts can also be added to an exclusion list, so that they will
not be monitored, and will not be added to the new_hosts.cfg file.

Integrates DNS functionality from Stefan Schmidt's morepowerdns library.
